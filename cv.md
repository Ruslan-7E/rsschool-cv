## 👋 Hi, my name is **Ruslan Mukhametshin**!

## I'm a beginner _Fullstack software engineer_ from Kashira, Moscow oblast. My goal in the near future is to change my profession and become a demanded fullstask engineer. Of my strengths, I would single out the ability to quickly learn new things, communication skills, engineering thinking and a little perfectionism.
